# EmergencyResponse
So this was an emergency response app we did as part of our continuous assessment at the time, we managed to make it somewhat work but due to our lack of experience at the time, trigerring the app by shaking the phone resulted in the app sending SOS messages and never exiting the loop until it crashed, hopefuly now with the knowledge I have I can address that issue.
